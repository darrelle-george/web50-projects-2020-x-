# Project 0
I created a blog that offers fashion and travel services for women who are looking for a quick holiday/ weekend getaway and need help with styling, booking trips and creating itineraries for their vacation.

 My website contains four different .html pages and it is possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.


The "Home" page contains SCSS variables such as nesting to name a couple getaway countries that are easily accessible from the United States. I included two images for visual inspiration and a table with outfit ideas.

The "Trip Ideas"page contains bootstrap 4 grid model layout to showcase excursion ideas.

"Styling" page contains images for styling inspiration, SCSS variable  of inheritance to list the services that can be rendered.

Finally, the "Contact" page contains columns for social media and email contact, a form to get more information from potential clients and a video. pip3 install submit50
